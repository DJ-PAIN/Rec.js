## Performance Metrics

- Boot Time: 6.5 seconds
- Dorm Initialization (including amplitude): 15.8 seconds (may seem long, but its not)
- Coach's Dialogue on May 30th: 18.7 seconds
- Room Switching: 4.3 seconds
- Friend Finding: 1.3 seconds


### OpenRec Times 

- Dorm Initialization (including amplitude): 30.8 seconds 

That means OldRec is  64.37%* faster then OpenRec 

(* bc my math is shit)
