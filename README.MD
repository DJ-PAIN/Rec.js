## (not so) Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How is Rec.js different than OpenRec?

**A:** At the moment, there's not much of a difference between OpenRec and Rec.js. They both do the same job, which is allowing old Rec Room builds to be playable again.

Since OpenRec is no longer being worked on, Rec.js exists to be an improvement of OpenRec to include more features and better support for old Rec Room builds.

### Q: Is it possible to play with other people with Rec.js?

**A:** Yes! Multiplayer is handled with a [Photon PUN server](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) and a [Photon Voice server](https://www.photonengine.com/en-us/Voice), not via the RecNet server.

### Q: Is it possible for someone using OpenRec and someone using Rec.js to play together?

**A:** It is indeed possible for the same reasons listed [here](#q-is-it-possible-to-play-with-other-people-with-recjs)

### Q: My build doesn't work!

**A:** There are multiple reasons why this might be happening.

- We do not support 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023 builds (2018 will be coming soon).

- If there is no console output when you launch your build, that means the builds RecNet server domain has not been modified. 

- If there is console output but there is a "Failed to connect to RecNet!" error, [Submit an issue!](https://github.com/RealMCoded/Rec.js/issues)
